# Main Branch Push Workflow: Performs tagging and release when code is merged to the main branch
# This workflow performs the following tasks:
# 1. Gets version from package.json and updates the VERSION file
# 2. Creates and pushes a Git tag with that version (only if it doesn't already exist)
# 3. Automatically creates a GitHub release when a new tag is created
# This workflow uses the version information updated by the PR workflow to create releases
